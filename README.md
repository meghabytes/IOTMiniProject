Teachers often face challenges when they enter a classroom and need to set up their laptops 
and presentation slides. To streamline this process, we propose an IoT-based automatic 
teacher helper system. Each teacher will be equipped with a specific sensor and unique ID, 
while all classrooms will be outfitted with sinks/servers. 
When a teacher enters the transmission range of a server, their unique ID will be transmitted. 
The server will then automatically trigger an actuator to initiate the connection process. This 
will ensure that the teacherâ€™s laptop and presentation content are seamlessly connected and 
displayed on the classroom monitor without any manual intervention. 
This system will be coded using the mobile sender static receiver model. The mobility 
models for the senders (teachers) will be designed to accurately reflect their movements. 
Additionally, robust checks will be implemented to ensure that only the teacher whose ID 
matches the preset requirement can trigger the actuator, ensuring secure and accurate display 
of content. 
This innovative solution will significantly reduce setup time, allowing teachers to focus more 
on teaching and less on technical difficulties, thereby enhancing the overall educational 
experience.
